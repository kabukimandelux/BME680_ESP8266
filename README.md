# BME680_ESP8266
Code used to send BME680 sensor data from my ESP8266's via MQTT in JSON format

The Pimoroni BME680 uses the IC2 address 0x76. Change it in the code if yours uses a different one
BME680 is connected to the 5v pin on the ESP8266

If you're using a Wemos D1 mini, connect the SCL to D1 and the SDA to D2
